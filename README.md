Title: Project 2
Team: Kimberly Childers, Joshua Hale, and Damarje Brown

Project Description: 
  Project 2 required team members to work together to explore how to extract data utilizing Python and Pandas, transform and clean data, parse string data, place data in dictionaries, use lists to display readable code, and manipulate     strings using regular expressions. Team 2 accomplished this by creating Category/Subcategory, Campaign, Contacts, and Crowdfunding data frames. 

  Analysis:
    1) Category data frame was created. Reference category dataframe file "category.csv"
    2) Subcategory data frame was created. Reference subcategory dataframe file "subcategory.csv"
    3) Campaign data frame was created. Reference campaign dataframe file "campaign.csv"
    4) Contact data frame was created. Reference contact dataframe file "contacts.csv"
    5) Crowdfunding database was created. Reference crowdfunding database file "crowdfunding_db"
